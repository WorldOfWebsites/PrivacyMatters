	 <p id="description">This page will explain why privacy matters.</p>
	 <p>In the digital world, computers have taken over our lives. We keep very sensitive and personal things on computers, and our internet habits can say a lot about us. Even metadata alone. The problem with the NSA/GCHQ is not that they're spying. It's that they're spying on <em>everyone.</em> This is not to say that there is some government worker actually watching whatever you do, but all this information is being pulled into a database "just in case". The amount of info they've been collecting could be gauged by the fact the NSA built a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Data_Center">datacenter</a> for the storage of data.</p>
     <h3 class="center-align">So What's the Point?</h3>
	 <p>In democratic countries at least, the right to privacy and protection against unreasonable searches is protected. The United States has the 4<sup>th</sup> Amendment. Canada has it covered under section 8 of the Canadian Charter Rights and Freedoms. The mass spying of these agencies says otherwise. But rights are rights. They were never meant to be fought for. They are just there. But now to truly keep the right to privacy, now we have to fight for it.</p>
	 <p>United States 4<sup>th</sup> Amendment:</p>
	 <blockquote>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>
	 <p>Section 8 of the Canadian Charter Rights and Freedoms:</p>
	 <blockquote>Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.</blockquote>
