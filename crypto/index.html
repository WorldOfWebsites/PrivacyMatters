	 <p>Cryptography is the scrambling of data, which can only be unlocked with a certain key. There are two types of cryptography: symmetric and asymmetric. You will find details for both types below.</p>

	 <h1 class="center-align">Symmetric Encryption</h1>
	 <p>A symmetric cipher uses one key to encrypt and decrypt. This is much faster compared to asymmetric encryption. But there is the problem of exchanging the key, which can't just be sent away in the clear (unencrypted).</p>

	 <h1 class="center-align">Asymmetric Encryption</h1>
	 <p>An asymmetric cipher, also known as public-key-cryptography uses two keys: a public key, used to encrypt data, and a private key used to decrypt. You can put the public key anywhere - you can only encrypt to it. The private key is the one you keep private, hence its name. PGP/GPG is an example of just that. But since encrypting data with this type of encryption is slow, especially with large amounts of data, PGP/GPG actually encrypts data with a symmetric key, known as a session key. That key is encrypted with the recipiant's public key and sent over.</p>
