     <h1 class="center-align">What is SMS and How Does it Work?</h1>
     <p>SMS stands for Short Message Service and it is a way to send messages over a carrier network to a phone with a valid phone number. Think of the phone number as a username, or address to send a letter to. When you send a message, it gets sent to the Short Message Center (SMC) which holds on to the message until the phone is discovered and the message is relayed. So the fundamental system is a store-and-forward system. There are a number of concerns with this method and that will be explained below.</p>

     <h1 class="center-align">Security Flaws</h1>
     <p>SMS is a fundamentally flawed, insecure means of communication. Messages are sent unencrypted, or if the network is encrypted, it is sent with very weak encryption which can be cracked in a reasonable amount of time. If you're the NSA or any well funded intellgence agency or even a person with lots of money and who knows where to look, you can crack in almost, if not real time. SMS messages are sent and recieved on the Signaling System 7 (SS7) protocol, which has hacked secure messaging apps. The crypto was well built and sound, but the signup process uses SMS and that's a very weak link.</p>
     <p>SS7 is the protocol that handles the information to transfer a phone call, relay SMS messages and allows users to roam between networks. Once someone is inside that network, they can read SMS messages, listen to phone calls and track your location, as the phone communicates with the carrier towers so that the towers and the phone are on the same page. Which basically gives them the power close to the NSA.</p>
     <p>Another concern is the servers. You may think that SMS is a peer to peer system. It's not. It uses servers, just like any IM service does. In this case, the servers are controlled by the telcos, where in some countries are all or at least some of the telcos are state-owned. Since the messages are sent unencrypted, this allows anyone with access to the SMC to read all the messages sent on the network. On top of that, local laws may or may not dictate a requirement to store the messages for a set amount of time. It depends on the country.</p>
     <p>Think about it: you've probably sent a very personal message over SMS. You wouldn't want anybody reading that, or any message for that matter. But that message was sent on an unencrypted, weak protocol (thanks for nothing SS7) that can be read in real time, or later. The carriers will say "Don't worry, we delete it once the message has been sent and we do not keep it any longer. <em>Trust us.</em> You seriously won't take their word for it, the messages are unencrypted so they can be read. If it's not them, it could be the works of your country's intelligence agency or even local police with these delightful (sarcasm right there) devices called Stingrays or IMSI Catchers, which you can read about <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/meet-the-machines-that-steal-your-phones-data/">here.</a></p>

     <h1 class="center-align">How do I Protect Myself From the Flaws of SMS?</h1>
     <p>The best way to protect yourself from the flaws of SMS is <em>not to use SMS.</em> Use encrypted messaging apps such as Signal, or if you kust use SMS, use Silence. You can read all about them from the <a href="../tools/index.html">tools</a> page.</p>
